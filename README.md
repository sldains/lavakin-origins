A datapack that adds the origin Lava Wyrmling to the Origins mod for Minecraft.

This datapack requires the Origins mod for Fabric to run.

# Lava Wyrmling
A creature of the Nether born from lava.
``` 
+ Fire Immunity
+ Can swim and see in lava with ease
+ Can eat anything without consequence
+ Can eat Magma Cream using primary active power
+ Swimming in lava heals
+ Elytra Flight
/ Sprinting boosts flight at the cost of hunger
- More fall damage
- Lower max health
- Nether Spawn
- Obsidian Shell: water/cold blocks causes a hard shell of obsidian to form
                  resulting in Resistance 2 and Slowness 5
```
I built and balanced this datapack on a modpack with beefed up enemies so I can't attest to its balance for a more normal minecraft experience. 

This is a origin where the Nether is life and the Overworld is filled with perils. 
It reverses the normal Minecraft fear of lava to replace it for a distrust of water without making water just death (like hydrophobia).

For the best experience I suggest pairing this with the mod Better Nether.
